# **Project Altair \- Software Sub-team Recruitment '23**

Welcome to my submission repository for the Project Altair Software Sub-team Recruitment process. This repository contains all my solutions and code for the weekly tasks.

### **About This Repository**

As an Electrical and Electronic Engineering student with a passion for Python development and a strong interest in pursuing AI/ML, I've structured this repository to be a clean, organized, and professional showcase of my problem-solving abilities and technical skills. My goal is to demonstrate not just the completion of tasks, but also a commitment to best practices in coding and version control.

### **Repository Structure**

This repository is organized by week, as per the recruitment guidelines. Each week's tasks are contained within their own dedicated directory.

This week focused on foundational skills in microcontroller programming, sensor theory, communication protocols, and essential UNIX/Linux command-line operations.

* **UNIX Terminal / ROS Prerequisites:**  
  * **File:** Week 1/UNIX Terminal Task/create\_altair\_executable.sh  
  * **Description:** A bash script designed to run in a Linux environment. It automates the creation of a directory structure and a Python executable file (hello.py). The script then sets the file ownership to root and modifies its permissions to 700, making it executable only by the root user, as per the task requirements.  
  * **Technologies Used:** Bash, Docker (for Debian environment), Git
